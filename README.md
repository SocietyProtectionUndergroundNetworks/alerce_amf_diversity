# About
This repository contains the data, code, and analyses for the study: Arbuscular mycorrhizal diversity correlates with tree size in an Alerce forest (Fitzroya cupressoides) with one of oldest living trees on earth

# Contents 
data/ – Metadata, 

bioinformatics_LotuS2/ – All scripts, config files, and custom databases for the running of LotuS2

R_scripts/ – Analysis scripts (e.g., data processing, statistical analysis, visualization): decontamination and taxonomic assignment of mycorrhizal fungi

results/ – Processed outputs, figures, and supplementary materials 



# Methods 
Bioinformatics: LotuS2 analyses of ITS2 and SSU amplicons sequenced from soil eDNA. Analysis: Community composition, alpha/beta diversity metrics, ordination, and statistical modeling Software: Analyses performed in R and Python, using packages such as phyloseq, vegan, and ggplot2 Reproducibility To reproduce our analyses:

# Clone this repository:
